# tictactoe
A Tic Tac Toe game in python 
the computer plays the game using 'X's;
the user play the game using 'O's;
the first move belongs to the computer - it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)
the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose - the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
the program checks if the game is over - there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, or the game ends with a tie, your win, or the computer's win;
the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
